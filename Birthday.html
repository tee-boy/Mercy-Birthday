            <p>
                The first time i spoke to "MERCY EMUMWEN" was in the year 2016, january
                in jss 1(one). After the christimas break in second term during  a mixed general class.While the first time i saw her was in 2013 on the express in her mom's car! (I know she'd be shocked!)

            <h3>THE SECONDARY SCH life‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
            <p>Well i started having what i will call "A THINGü´Ç" for mercy during our
                BECE examination in jss3. But didnt do nothing because i was uncertain &
                wasnt close to her. then things changed in SS1 when she started dating One
                of "The trio". that is, I and My two (2) closest freinds. And i personally
                decided to get back at her out of anger by making her my BESTIE‚ù§Ô∏è. Then
                i realized that my freind is too  close to me to try such.to avoid issues, I decided to abstain from her with
                her still being my bestie.üßë‚Äçü¶±
